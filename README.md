# Sidiq_Portfolio
## Description

In this project I will be creating a portfolio of work that can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
With these points in mind, in this Challenge I will be applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search.

### User Story

```
AS bootcamp student
I want to create a portfilio website that showcase my skills and talents
So the portfilo has information about me, displays my projects and lists my contact details.
```
### Acceptance Criteria

The portfilo must meet accessibility standards. it can be achieved by completing the following:

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:
When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
